                    <h2>About</h2>
                    <p>Hi there, my name is Jack Chambers and this is my personal website. At the moment it is a bit bare, 
                    but I will be updating it over time with info on projects I am working on. Currently, I am interested in using 3D graphics in a web context, learning various web frameworks, and video game development.</p>
                    
                    <p>I have 4+ years of experience working in the IT field with companies of various sizes in San Francisco and Seattle. I am currently based out of Oakland, California. 
                    I am currently looking for IT Engineer and Junior Software Developer roles. You can view my resume <a href="https://www.visualcv.com/pmpstjpoc0y/">here</a>. </p>

                    <p>The source for this website can be found on <a href="https://github.com/goodatsports/sharkpatrol">github</a>. At the moment, it is a static website hosted on AWS. 
                    Three.js provides the WebGL rendering and composition, and Node provides the routing and local development environment.</p>
